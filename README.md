# Sleep Apnea Detection Using MATLAB and Fourier Transform  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This project focuses on detecting sleep apnea using *MATLAB* by analyzing respiratory signals through the *Fourier Transform*. By converting time-domain signals into the frequency domain, we can identify distinct frequency patterns associated with apnea events.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ *Signal Preprocessing* – Noise removal and normalization  
✅ *Fourier Transform Analysis* – Extracting key frequency components  
✅ *Feature Extraction* – Identifying apnea-related patterns  
✅ *Visualization* – Graphical representation of normal vs. apnea signals  
✅ *Automated Detection* – Classifying apnea events using spectral analysis  

## 📦 Requirements  
- *MATLAB* (R2021a or later)  
- *Signal Processing Toolbox*  
- *Dataset* (Respiratory signal data in .mat or .csv format)  

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  
1. *Clone the repository*
